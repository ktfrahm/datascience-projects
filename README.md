# Data Science Projects

This repository contains two data science projects: **Loan Default Prediction** and **Potential Lead Prediction**. Both projects are implemented in Jupyter notebooks and demonstrate various machine learning techniques for predictive modeling.

## Projects Overview

### Loan Default Prediction

**Objective:** Predict whether a new borrower will default on their loan.

- **Dataset:** The dataset contains features related to borrower information, loan details, and repayment history.
- **Techniques Used:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, ANN, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

### Potential Lead Prediction

**Objective:** Predict if a lead will convert to a paying customer.

- **Dataset:** The dataset includes features related to lead demographics, interaction history, and marketing efforts.
- **Techniques Used:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Bagging, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
